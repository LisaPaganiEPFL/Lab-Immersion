# Mutant fate in a star population structure: bridging models and experiments 

The work was inpired by the preprinted paper [Experimental evidence that metapopulation structure can accelerate adaptive
evolution](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.13.452242v1).

This repository contains 2 folders. Below there is a description.

### [Paper experiments](https://github.com/LisaPaganiEPFL/Lab-Immersion/tree/main/Paper%20experiments)

This folder contrains two subfolders:
1) [Figure reproduction](https://github.com/LisaPaganiEPFL/Lab-Immersion/tree/main/Paper%20experiments/Figure%20reproduction) in which we tried to reproduce some of the figures of the paper.
2) [Variability](https://github.com/LisaPaganiEPFL/Lab-Immersion/tree/main/Paper%20experiments/Variability) in which we tried to take into account the high variability of the experimental results. 



### [Acceleration experiments](https://github.com/LisaPaganiEPFL/Lab-Immersion/tree/main/Acceleration%20experiments)

In this folder there are the results of a new experiment that can lead a reseracher to acceleration in the star configuration.
